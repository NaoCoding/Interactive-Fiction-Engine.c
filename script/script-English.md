...Vision gradually clears to reveal a school hallway at night...

### Hallway ###
>I: Why am I here? I can't remember anything. Ouch...why are there so many scratches on my arms and knees...

...The hallway seems as lively as during a school break, even though it's clearly evening...

>I: Two girls seem to be chatting ahead. It's strange that they're still here so late...

[Option]
- Listen to what they're talking about.

>**Girl A**: (scoffing) Have you seen the new girl? Her clothes are so outdated, it's obvious her family can barely afford to send her here.  
>**Girl B**: (dismissive) Yeah, I noticed that too. She might be kinda pretty but that doesn't make up for it. Like, why doesn't she ever hang out with anyone else?  
>**Girl A**: Exactly, she's always lurking around by herself like a total creep. Probably too embarrassed for anyone to find out how poor her family is.  
>**Girl B**: (snickering) Sucks to be her, but she's just so stuck-up too. I tried talking to her once and she barely gave me the time of day.  
>**Girl A**: I heard from Cathy that she was like that at her old school too. Maybe that's just her personality.  
>**Girl B**: But honestly, I'm kinda curious what her whole deal is. You think we should bother trying to get to know her better?  
>**Girl A**: (reluctant) Maybe, but why even bother? You know how it is with people like that - they always make things so complicated when you try being friendly.

- I shouldn't stir up trouble. Best to head into the classroom instead.

Date: September 12, 2023  

Received a gift card and an invitation from [Ichina]'s mother. Given her parents' background, I may need to be more cautious in handling class affairs.

---
Date: September 15, 2023

Note: Some students have reported that [Ichina] exhibited aggressive behavior towards classmates during break time. Observation will continue without immediate intervention to avoid unnecessary involvement from parents.

---
Date: September 17, 2023

Note: Today during the class meeting, [Brain] seemed downcast. When asked, he avoided the question. It's necessary to determine if this relates to [Ichina], but no direct evidence has been found; hence, no further inquiry will be made.

Date: September 22, 2023

Student Feedback: Issues involving [Ichina] again, reportedly being unfriendly to a newcomer after class with a few friends. However, direct evidence is lacking; will continue to observe.

Date: September 26, 2023

Personal Note: Accepted another small gift from [Ichina]'s parents as a thank-you for my 'special attention' during the semester. It was a whole box of expensive cigarettes, which I really appreciated.

Date: September 27, 2023

Parent Feedback: Received another inquiry from a parent about their child's emotional issues at school. I advised the parent to communicate directly with their student, as it is inappropriate for teachers to overly intervene in students' private matters, to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.

>I: [Ichina]?...This name sounds familiar...but I can't remember who she is. It seems like the teacher is really biased towards her...

**I**: (hesitantly) I... I'm not really sure myself. I just woke up at school. How about you?  
**Alex**: I was studying in the library and lost track of time. It's really quiet here, which feels a bit off.  
**I**: By the way, [Alex], have you heard about anything strange happening at school recently?  
**Alex**: (looking uneasy) Strange things? Hmm, I'm not sure. But, have you heard about the rumors concerning the rooftop?
**I**: Rumors about the rooftop? I'm not familiar, can you tell me more?  
**Alex**: They say sometimes you can hear weird noises up there, and some people have even seen... (pauses) Never mind, it's probably just nonsense.  
**I**: (curious) Do you believe those stories?  
**Alex**: (giving a wry smile) I don't know. But you should be careful, especially when you're alone in places like this.

[Memory Flashback] - Memory Increase 5%
>**I**: Ah...my head hurts so much.

...Suddenly, your vision blurs and flashes of both familiar and strange scenes flicker through your mind. The surroundings are dim; a girl is surrounded by a group of students. Through the blur, it’s seen that they are kicking her and pulling at her clothes. The girl looks terrified, her eyes brimming with tears...

>**...** : (voice trembling) "Why are you doing this to me? What did I do wrong?"  
**...** : (voice stern) "Because you're so annoying, always acting so sweet and making the teachers like you. We can't stand it!"  
**...** : (jeering) "Yeah, always acting like you're different from us. You're just a freak!"

>**I**: (Tears fall) Huh? Have I experienced this before? Is this real? Why am I remembering these things?

**Back to Reality**  
...You stand in the bathroom, take a deep breath trying to calm your emotions, and the scene returns to the empty bathroom...

[Option]
- Back to the classroom. Ask Alex about this.
>**I** : (confused) Why do I remember these things? Am I... could I be the one who was bullied?   
**Alex** : (concernedly) You don't look right. What happened?   
**I** : (shaking head) I'm not sure, but after I entered the bathroom, I saw a scene where a girl was being bullied by classmates.  
**Alex** : (softly comforting) Are you saying you recalled memories of being bullied before school? There were rumors of a girl being bullied here before, but I don’t know the details. Memories can distort for many reasons. Perhaps you need time to sort them out. What’s important now is to stay calm." - **Affinity increases**.

**Approach the Sink**  
...You stare at your reflection in the mirror, but something feels off. Your reflection seems blurry, as if a thin mist is lingering behind the glass. You reach out to touch the mirror, but your fingers appear translucent, like wisps of smoke...

>**I** : What's happening?... Why is it so blurry?

...You try to wipe the mist from the mirror, but the image remains hazy, unable to clearly reflect your face. Your eyes grow fearful and confused...

>**I** : Could it be… am I really…?

___
>**Alex** : (after a moment of thought) "What you just said reminded me... I often saw our teacher with cigarettes, he seemed to be heading to the rooftop to smoke."

**I** : (eagerly) "Really? Do you think the teacher might have a key to the rooftop?"

**Alex** : "I'm not sure, but I've seen them with some keys heading that way. Our teacher usually doesn’t let students notice these things, but I’ve caught glimpses."

**I** : (hope reignited) "What should we do then? Do you think we can find the key?"

**Alex** : (nodding) "It might be in the teachers' office. We could find some clues there."

**I** : (determined) "Alright, I have to try. If there’s anything there, it might help me understand what really happened."

**Alex** : "I'll wait here for your news. If you find something, or need help, just tell me."

>**I**: It turns out Ichina really has been bullying classmates, and it looks like the teachers have indeed been covering for her all along.

**[Hideout]**  
...Suddenly, the sound of a doorknob turning interrupts my thoughts. I urgently look for a hiding spot...

>**I**: Sh**t! Quick, find somewhere to hide! The teacher is back!

*Action prompt: Choose a hiding spot within 5 seconds to avoid being discovered.*

- **Closet** (Successfully hidden, not discovered)

>**I**: Can he not see me? Why? He walks right past me, oblivious to my presence.

**The teacher turns off the lights and leaves the office.**

*Action prompt: Quickly head to the rooftop with the key while staying alert.*

### Rooftop ###

...The rooftop is very old, with some tiles broken or loose. It hasn't been cleaned for a long time, with leaves, cigarette butts, and trash everywhere. In the corner, some forgotten school supplies like old chairs and broken equipment are swaying gently in the wind, making creaking sounds...

*Campus Tragedy: Suicide Highlights Potential Bullying Issues*  
Local News — Earlier this week, a tragic suicide occurred at a well-known high school in the city. A female student ended her young life by overdosing on sleeping pills on campus. It is reported that the girl was a current student at the school, described by friends as an introverted and academically excellent student who seemed to struggle with adapting to school life.

After the incident, rumors about the girl possibly being bullied for a long time spread widely among the students. Some anonymous classmates revealed that the girl might have been targeted because of her appearance and personality traits. They described her as someone who often wandered alone during breaks, rarely interacting with other students.

In a statement, the school expressed deep sorrow and shock over the incident. They have initiated an internal investigation and are cooperating with the police to fully understand the circumstances leading up to the tragedy. The school emphasized their commitment to providing a safe and supportive learning environment and their zero-tolerance policy towards any form of bullying.

Furthermore, the school has contacted professional counselors to provide necessary psychological support services to all students, especially those affected by this incident.

Police stated that the investigation is ongoing and, given the involvement of minors, further details and information will be strictly confidential to respect the privacy of the victim and their family.

The incident calls for society to pay more attention to the mental health of teenagers and strengthen the prevention and intervention of school bullying. This event reminds us again of the importance of focusing on students' psychological well-being and creating a respectful and understanding school environment.

Report Date: October 3, 2023

- **Diary Page**: Torn-out pages with faint writing marks.

>>**Date: October 1, 2023**
Today is the second day since [Emily] left. I wish I had been there with her before she took the pills. Maybe she wouldn't have chosen to end her life. She was my best friend, and seeing her suffer made me feel helpless. Now I know I must take action. I must avenge her and find a way to release her pain.

>>**Date: October 3, 2023**
Today I made a plan. I know she was often called to the rooftop, where they verbally and physically attacked her. Every time I think about it, my heart bleeds. I will lure Ichina to the rooftop and make her pay for everything she did. I can't let her continue ruining others' lives.

>>**Date: October 5, 2023**
Tomorrow is the day. I plan to push her off the rooftop when she’s not paying attention. It will look like a tragic suicide. I will make sure all signs point to suicide. I must stop her from hurting more people, even if it means going this far.

>>**Date: October 6, 2023**
Everything went according to plan. When she stood at the edge of the rooftop, I took action. It all happened so fast, she had no chance to react. Now, I must ensure the police don't suspect it was murder. To buy time, I decided to lock the school's main entrance with an electronic lock, creating confusion and delay. I hope this gives me enough time to erase any clues pointing to me.

#### Examine the newspaper first, followed by the diary page:

>**I**: Is this my fate? To commit suicide because of bullying? But I... why don't I remember? Did I really go through all this pain and then choose to end my life?

>**I**: Could it be... am I really dead? Is all of this, including me standing here, just an illusion?

>**I**: I can't stay here any longer. Every corner, every hallway, even these walls, remind me of all the pain I went through.

...You slowly stand up, take a deep breath, and prepare to leave this place filled with painful memories. With each step, you tell yourself that the answers lie ahead, or at least a glimmer of hope for freedom...

...At the rooftop door, you hear a noise and see a classmate hurriedly avoiding your gaze and running away...

[Option] Chase after them / Stay on the rooftop

- Chase after them:

Can't catch up:
>**I**: Wait! Why are you running? Please help me!
...You chase after the classmate, but they disappear at the end of the hallway. However, you find yourself at the school exit. The door is locked with a code lock...

*Action prompt: Solve the code to unlock the school exit.*

Catch up:
>**I**: (gently) Wait, please don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
>**Brain**: (backing away, voice trembling) No... don't come near me! How are you here? Aren't you already...
>**I**: (confused) Already what? I woke up and found myself at school, unable to remember anything. I just want to leave here. Can you help me?
>**Brain**: (mustering some courage) Don't you remember? You... you used to treat us so badly. You always bullied us, made us afraid of you.
>**I**: (shocked and self-doubting) Bully? Me? I... I remember being isolated, being bullied...
>**Brain**: (nervously looking at me) How is that possible? To us, you were the one who made us live in fear every day. I... I thought I'd never have to see you again.
>**I**: (deeply frowning) How can this be? I always thought I was the victim. Could it be that what I just remembered isn't true?
>**Brain**: (trying to speak calmly) I don't know how you're here now, or how you came back. But I really hope you leave me alone. I don't want to be haunted by the past anymore.
>**I**: (tears in eyes) I'm... I'm sorry. If I really did those things, I'm so sorry. I need to figure out what happened, I need to know the truth...
>**Brain**: (softening slightly) Maybe you should. But please give me some space. I'm not sure I'm ready to face you again, at least not now. Goodbye, Ichina.
>**I**: (quickly) Hey! Wait...!
>**Brain**: (already disappearing into the darkness)

>**I**: How did it come to this... I made others feel so desperate because of me. And I, I became the source of all this pain.

>>"I wish I could go back and change everything." Now, I'm just a wandering soul in the school, my life is over, but the harm I caused still exists. Is this my punishment? Death didn't bring relief, it only highlighted my sins."

>>"If time could turn back, I would change everything, I would stop myself from going down the path of hurting others. But now, all I can do is use my story to warn current and future students about the serious consequences of bullying."

#### Code Lock:
The code lock screen prompts: The day everything ended. Code: Deduced from Brain's diary, the date of Emily's suicide: 0930
