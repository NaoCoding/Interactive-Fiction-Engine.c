...Vision gradually clears to reveal a school hallway at night...
### Hallway ###
>I: Why I am here? I can't remember anything. ouch...why there are lots of scratches on my arms and knees...

...he hallway seems as lively as during a school break, even though it's clearly evening...

>I: Two girls seems are chatting ahead. It's strange that they're still here so late...

[option]
- Listen to what they're talking about.
>**Girl A**: (scoffing) Have you seen the new girl? It’s obvious her family can barely afford her schooling; just look at her outdated clothes.  
**Girl B**: (dismissive) I noticed. She might be pretty, but that doesn’t make up for much. I mean, why doesn’t she mix with anyone else?  
**Girl A**: Exactly, she's always lurking by herself, like a shadow. It’s creepy. Probably too embarrassed to let anyone find out about her home situation.  
**Girl B**: (snickering) I guess it’s tough being her, but isn’t she just too standoffish? I tried to chat with her once, and she barely gave me the time of day.  
**Girl A**: That’s just how she is. I heard from Cathy she was a loner at her old school too. Maybe that’s just her personality.  
**Girl B**: (cynically) Some people are just like that, huh? But honestly, I’m curious about what her deal is. Do you think we should even bother trying to know her better?  
**Girl A**: (reluctant) Maybe, but honestly, why bother? You know how it is with people like that, always making things complicated when you try to get a little friendly.  


- I shouldn't stir up trouble. Best to head into the classroom instead.

Date: September 12, 2023  

Received a gift card and an invitation from [Ichina]'s mother. Given her parents background, I may need to be more cautious in handling class affairs.

---
Date: September 20, 2023

Note: Some students have reported that [Ichina] exhibited aggressive behavior towards classmates during break time. Observation will continue without immediate intervention to avoid unnecessary involvement from parents.

Date: September 30, 2023

Note: Today during the class meeting, [John] seemed downcast. When asked, he avoided the question. It's necessary to determine if this relates to [Ichina], but no direct evidence has been found; hence, no further inquiry will be made.

Date: October 3, 2023

Student Feedback: Issues involving [Ichina] again, reportedly being unfriendly to a newcomer after class with a few friends. However, direct evidence is lacking; will continue to observe.

Date: October 15, 2023

Personal Note: Accepted another small gift from [Ichina]'s parents as a thank-you for my 'special attention' during the semester. It was a whole box of expensive cigarettes, which I really appreciated.

Date: October 25, 2023

Parent Feedback: Received another inquiry from a parent about their child's emotional issues at school. I advised the parent to communicate directly with their student, as it is inappropriate for teachers to overly intervene in students' private matters, to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.

>I: [Ichina]?...This name sounds familiar...but I can't remember who she is. It seems like the teacher is really biased towards her...

**A**: (looking uneasy) Strange things? Hmm, I'm not sure. But, have you heard about the rumors concerning the rooftop?
**I**: Rumors about the rooftop? I'm not familiar, can you tell me more?  
**A**: They say sometimes you can hear weird noises up there, and some people have even seen... (pauses) Never mind, it's probably just nonsense.  
**I**: (curious) Do you believe those stories?  
**A**: (giving a wry smile) I don't know. But you should be careful, especially when you're alone in places like this.

Through the blur, it’s seen that they are kicking her and pulling at her clothes. The girl looks terrified, her eyes brimming with tears...  

>**...** : (voice trembling) "Why are you doing this to me? What did I do wrong?"  
**...** : (voice stern) "Because you're so annoying, always acting so sweet and making the teachers like you. We can't stand it!"

**A** : (concernedly) You don't look right. What happened?   
**I** : (shaking head) I'm not sure, but after I entered the bathroom, I saw a scene where a girl was being bullied by classmates.  
**A** : (softly comforting) Are you saying you recalled memories of being bullied before school? There were rumors of a girl being bullied here before, but I don’t know the details. Memories can distort for many reasons. Perhaps you need time to sort them out. What’s important now is to stay calm." - **Affinity increases**.

**A** : "I'm not sure, but I've seen them with some keys heading that way. our teacher usually don’t let students notice these things, but I’ve caught glimpses."

**I** : (hope reignited) "What should we do then? Do you think we can find the key?"

**A** : (nodding) "It might be in the teachers' office. We could find some clues there."

**I** : (determined) "Alright, I have to try. If there’s anything there, it might help me understand what really happened."

*Campus Tragedy: Suicide Highlights Potential Bullying Issues*

Local News — Earlier this week, a tragic suicide occurred at a well-known high school in the city. A female student ended her young life by overdosing on sleeping pills on campus. It is reported that the girl was a current student at the school, described by friends as an introverted and academically excellent student who seemed to struggle with adapting to school life.

After the incident, rumors about the girl possibly being bullied for a long time spread widely among the students. Some anonymous classmates revealed that the girl might have been targeted because of her appearance and personality traits. They described her as someone who often wandered alone during breaks, rarely interacting with other students.

In a statement, the school expressed deep sorrow and shock over the incident. They have initiated an internal investigation and are cooperating with the police to fully understand the circumstances leading up to the tragedy. The school emphasized their commitment to providing a safe and supportive learning environment and their zero-tolerance policy towards any form of bullying.

Furthermore, the school has contacted professional counselors to provide necessary psychological support services to all students, especially those affected by this incident.

Police stated that the investigation is ongoing and, given the involvement of minors, further details and information will be strictly confidential to respect the privacy of the victim and their family.

The incident calls for society to pay more attention to the mental health of teenagers and strengthen the prevention and intervention of school bullying. This event reminds us again of the importance of focusing on students' psychological well-being and creating a respectful and understanding school environment.
