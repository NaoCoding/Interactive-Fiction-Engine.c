...Vision gradually clears to reveal a school hallway at night...
### Hallway ###
>I: Why I am here? I can't remember anything. ouch...why there are lots of scratches on my arms and knees...

...he hallway seems as lively as during a school break, even though it's clearly evening...

>I: Two girls seems are chatting ahead. It's strange that they're still here so late...

[option]
- Listen to what they're talking about.
>**Girl A**: (scoffing) Have you seen the new girl, [Bullied Protagonist]? It’s obvious her family can barely afford her schooling; just look at her outdated clothes.  
**Girl B**: (dismissive) I noticed. She might be pretty, but that doesn’t make up for much. I mean, why doesn’t she mix with anyone else?
**Girl A**: Exactly, she's always lurking by herself, like a shadow. It’s creepy. Probably too embarrassed to let anyone find out about her home situation.  
**Girl B**: (snickering) I guess it’s tough being her, but isn’t she just too standoffish? I tried to chat with her once, and she barely gave me the time of day.  
**Girl A**: That’s just how she is. I heard from Cathy she was a loner at her old school too. Maybe that’s just her personality.
**Girl B**: (cynically) Some people are just like that, huh? But honestly, I’m curious about what her deal is. Do you think we should even bother trying to know her better?  
**Girl A**: (reluctant) Maybe, but honestly, why bother? You know how it is with people like that, always making things complicated when you try to get a little friendly.  


- I shouldn't stir up trouble. Best to head into the classroom instead.

We appreciate your cooperation and understanding as we work to maintain a safe environment for everyone.

Thank you."


### Classroom ###

...It's eerily quiet and completely empty. The moonlight streaming through the window illuminates the clock on the wall — it's midnight...
> I: 

[Item]  
- **Diary** - Memory increase 5% :  
 (A diary on the teacher's desk) The last few days' pages torn out.
>I: Why are the latest pages missing...what could have been written here?
- **Note**- Memory increase 5% :   
(a note in the trach bin at the back of the classroom) "Call her to the rooftop after class"written on it.


### Teacher's office ###
[Item]  
- **Work journal** - Memory increase 5% :  


(records of the teacher's inaction and gifts received from [Ichina]'s parents)  

---
Date: September 12, 2023  

Received a gift card and an invitation from [Ichina]'s mother. Given her parents background, I may need to be more cautious in handling class affairs.

---
Date: September 20, 2023

Note: Some students have reported that [Ichina] exhibited aggressive behavior towards classmates during break time. Observation will continue without immediate intervention to avoid unnecessary involvement from parents.

Date: September 30, 2023

Note: Today during the class meeting, [John] seemed downcast. When asked, he avoided the question. It's necessary to determine if this relates to [Ichina], but no direct evidence has been found; hence, no further inquiry will be made.

---
Date: October 3, 2023

Student Feedback: Issues involving [Ichina] again, reportedly being unfriendly to a newcomer after class with a few friends. However, direct evidence is lacking; will continue to observe.

---
Date: October 15, 2023

Personal Note: Accepted another small gift from [Ichina]'s parents as a thank-you for my 'special attention' during the semester. It was a whole box of expensive cigarettes, which I really appreciated.

Date: October 25, 2023

Parent Feedback: Received another inquiry from a parent about their child's emotional issues at school. I advised the parent to communicate directly with their student, as it is inappropriate for teachers to overly intervene in students' private matters, to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts.

>I: [Ichina]?...This name sounds familiar...but I can't remember who she is. It seems like the teacher is really biased towards her...


### Rooftop ###
...The rooftop is locked, unable to enter...
> I: Why am I drawn to go there? ...I need to find a way to get in. Maybe after getting into the rooftop, I can recall what happened to me.

### return to classroom ###
...Suddenly, [classmate A] appears, looking as surprised to see me as I am to see him...


**chat with A** - Memory increase 10% :

>**A**: (surprised) It's so late, why are you still here?  
**I**: (hesitantly) I... I'm not really sure myself. I just woke up at school. How about you?  
**A**: I was studying in the library and lost track of time. It's really quiet here, which feels a bit off.  
**I**: By the way, [A], have you heard about anything strange happening at school recently?  
**A**: (looking uneasy) Strange things? Hmm, I'm not sure. But, have you heard about the rumors concerning the rooftop?
**I**: Rumors about the rooftop? I'm not familiar, can you tell me more?  
**A**: They say sometimes you can hear weird noises up there, and some people have even seen... (pauses) Never mind, it's probably just nonsense.  
**I**: (curious) Do you believe those stories?  
**A**: (giving a wry smile) I don't know. But you should be careful, especially when you're alone in places like this.
