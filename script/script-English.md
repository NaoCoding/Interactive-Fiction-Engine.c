...Vision gradually clears to reveal a school hallway at night...
### Hallway ###
>I: Why I am here? I can't remember anything. ouch...why there are lots of scratches on my arms and knees...

...he hallway seems as lively as during a school break, even though it's clearly evening...

>I: Two girls seems are chatting ahead. It's strange that they're still here so late...

[option]
- Listen to what they're talking about.
>Girl 1: (scoffing) Have you seen the new girl, [Bullied Protagonist]? It’s obvious her family can barely afford her schooling; just look at her outdated clothes.  
Girl 2: (dismissive) I noticed. She might be pretty, but that doesn’t make up for much. I mean, why doesn’t she mix with anyone else?
Girl 1: Exactly, she's always lurking by herself, like a shadow. It’s creepy. Probably too embarrassed to let anyone find out about her home situation.  
Girl 2: (snickering) I guess it’s tough being her, but isn’t she just too standoffish? I tried to chat with her once, and she barely gave me the time of day.  
Girl 1: That’s just how she is. I heard from Cathy she was a loner at her old school too. Maybe that’s just her personality.
Girl 2: (cynically) Some people are just like that, huh? But honestly, I’m curious about what her deal is. Do you think we should even bother trying to know her better?  
Girl 1: (reluctant) Maybe, but honestly, why bother? You know how it is with people like that, always making things complicated when you try to get a little friendly.  


- I shouldn't stir up trouble. Best to head into the classroom instead.

...It's eerily quiet and completely empty. The moonlight streaming through the window illuminates the clock on the wall — it's midnight...
