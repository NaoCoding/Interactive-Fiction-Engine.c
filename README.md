## How to create your own game / story

```
First of all, you need to write a script.yaml
It contains all of your game's / story's settings.
```

* script.yaml
```c
Format :

#script   //must be placed at the first line of your script.yaml

#general  //general settings of your script
title:"Hello World" 



```
